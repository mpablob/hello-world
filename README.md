# hello-world
Repos for learning github.

This README is just something for me to practice with.

This file's extention is "md". What does that mean?

Google says:

MD, or markdown document is a text file created using one of several possible
dialects of the Markdown language. MD files use plain text formatting but
includes inline text symbols that define how to format the text, and is
designed for authoring plain text documentation that can be easily converted to
HTML.
